description: "The Two Admirals is an 1842 nautical fiction novel by James Fenimore\
  \ Cooper. The novel was written after the Leatherstocking Tales novel The Deerslayer.\
  \ Set during the 18th century and exploring the British Royal Navy, Cooper wrote\
  \ the novel out of encouragement of his English publisher, who recommended writing\
  \ another sea novel. Cooper had originally intended to write a novel where ships\
  \ were the main characters, though eventually decided not to. The novels is one\
  \ of three novels which Cooper would revise for editions following their first printing,\
  \ the other two being The Pathfinder and Deerslayer.\nWhen republishing the novel\
  \ in the 1860s, Cooper's Daughter, Susan Fenimore Cooper, described the novel as\
  \ \"the least successful of his romances of the sea\". Despite the novel not having\
  \ a large legacy, critic Stev Harthorn describes the novel as one of Cooper's deepest\
  \ studies of masculinity.\nThe original manuscript for the novel is held by the\
  \ Special Collections Department at the University of Virginia Library and contains\
  \ 257 pages.\n From Wikipedia (CC BY-SA)."
